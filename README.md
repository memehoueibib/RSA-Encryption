## About The Project
Our project utilizes Java Swing for the graphical user interface and Javaâ€™s cryptography libraries for the RSA encryption logic. The key features of this project include generating RSA key pairs, encrypting and decrypting messages, and presenting an intuitive GUI for user interaction.

### Built With
- Java
- Java Swing
- Java's `BigInteger` and `SecureRandom` classes

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/memehoueibib/RSA-Encryption.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your Java IDE of choice.
3. Compile and run the `Main` class.

## Usage
The application is straightforward to use:
1. **Start the Application**: Run the `Main` class to open the GUI.
2. **Generate RSA Keys**: Upon startup, the application automatically generates RSA key pairs.
3. **Encrypt a Message**: Enter a message in the provided text field and click on the 'Encrypt' button.
4. **Decrypt a Message**: The encrypted message can be decrypted by clicking the 'Decrypt' button.
